# UFOs
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a clean web page that contains a dynamic table of UFO sightings. We designed this table using Javascript as the main coding language. Through the web page, end users can filter data by various criteria and view the results immediately.
### Results
This is the homepage of our webpage completed through JavaScript.

By typing in the suggested placeholder elements as the filters, the result returns 3 matches. Make sure to type everything in lower case letters and do not have spaces at the end of the text. Click off the input box or press enter to initiate the filter . To reset the filter criteria, click the UFO Sightings at the top left of the website.
### Summary

#### Drawback
Although the table is great, one drawback is that the Javascript language is case sensitive. This may affect the user experience because all searchable data is lowercase. For example, if the user enters "CA" to identify UFO sightings in California, the filter search result is zero. However, if they type "ca" in lowercase letters, the results are many.

#### Recommendations

In total, our shape filter has more than seven "shape" results. The filter currently allows end users to filter shape data by simply typing search criteria in the search bar. If there is a "shape" drop-down option due to the wide range of description, the drop-down option will enhance the user experience. Those who are unfamiliar with UFO sightings may not know that "light" is considered to be the shape of UFOs.

It will also enhance the user experience, including a search result counter that shows the number of results for the search criteria.
